#Project 1: Algorithmic Problem-Solving Strategies

NOTE: All papers must be in a form which can be checked by blackboard, and appear as a submission outside of a zip file.

**Introduction**

**Give the big picture of the problem.**
How do algorithmic problem solving strategies differ from algorithms
How does the sorting of a collection of numbers relate to the algorithmic problem solving strategies
Which three will be investigated, by interfacing with the ABC (Abstract Base Class) of Problem.
Give structure of the report

**Background**
Maybe mention SOLID and the required methods to use the ABC and the class methods Divide and Conquer, Greedy and Las Vegas

**Design**
How is the code structured? (UML) 
Show the Is_A hierarchy 

**Experimental Design and Analysis**
Discuss how you measured performance, what type of plots do you use.
