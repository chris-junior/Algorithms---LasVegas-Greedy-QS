Project 1: 
Algorithmic Problem-Solving Strategies

NOTE: All papers must be in a form which can be checked by blackboard, and appear as a submission outside of a zip file.

Introduction

Give the big picture of the problem.  

How do algorithmic problem solving strategies differ from algorithms

How does the sorting of a collection of numbers relate to the algorithmic problem solving strategies

Which three will be investigated, by interfacing with the ABC of Problem.

Give structure of the report

Background

Maybe mention SOLID and the required methods to use the ABC (Abstract Base Class) and the class methods Divide and Conquer, Greedy and Las Vegas

Design
How is the code structured? (UML) 

Show the Is_A hierarchy 

Experimental Design and Analysis
Discuss how you measured performance, what type of plots do you use

Always discuss the figure in the text

Provide a plot of the results, with a function (n log n) times a constant bounding the measured runtimes for the sorts from below and above.

A log linear plot of the results would take the log(n log n) which would result in log(n) + log(log(n)), a linear-linear plot would be almost a straight line, with a slope increasing by log(n) (slight curve up) while a linear-log plot would highlight the upward curve (the increase in slope).  All are valid, just make sure to note which one you are using and why.

Conclusion

Summarize the introduction (not including the structure) and state major result.
